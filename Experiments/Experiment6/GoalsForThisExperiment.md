1. First I would like to create a parser which functions along the lines of how Experiment 5 does, but improved in any way that seems fit.
2. Second I would like to create a solver which functions along the lines of how Experiment 3 does, but with several improvements.
3. Third I would like to create something to create divs which look like what is found in Experiment 2 (I will put this on the side of a cube).
4. I would like to implement something like the cube in Experiment 1, but with one of the sides having the div (created above) on it.
   This div should rotate as the cube is rotated, so the sudoku puzzle must be able to be rotated properly.
